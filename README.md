# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview 

For this project we have created an app, PlanMyTrip. The app helps travelers pick cities where they would like to visit based on weather data. The app asks for temperature ranges and then gathers any city, as well as hotel information, that falls within the applicable range. 

From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we have created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
